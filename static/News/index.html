        <h3>Local Organizations Honored with Air Quality Partnership Excellence Awards</h3>
        <p>Each year, the Air Quality Partnership (AQP) recognizes private and public institutions that have made exceptional
            efforts to improve air quality in Greater Philadelphia. The recipients of the 2016 AQP Excellence Awards are
            Johnson Matthey (JM) in Devon, PA, and West Chester University (WCU) in West Chester, PA.
        </p>

        <h4>Johnson Matthey Inc.</h4>
        <p>JM is a world leader in emission control catalysts, or catalytic converters, for automobiles, trucks, off-road vehicles,
            locomotives, and stationary source pollutant emitters. These catalysts help destroy harmful pollutants and minimize
            the emission of greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide. JM's catalysts improve air quality not just
            in the Delaware Valley but across the U.S. and the world. In 2007, JM launched "Sustainability 2017," a global
            campaign with ambitious targets of halving the company's carbon intensity, halving resources consumed per unit
            of output, and achieving zero waste to landfill. JM has also helped raise public awareness about air quality
            through its advocacy for tougher emissions legislation and its sponsorship of local cycling events and running
            teams.

        <h4>West Chester University</h4>
        <p>WCU invested in cutting emissions and pollution by expanding the campus's geothermal distribution system and adding
            to its fleet of vehicles powered by compressed natural gas (CNG). The geothermal heating and cooling system services
            more than 40% of WCU's North Campus building space and replaced a coal-fired boiler plant. The University's fleet
            of CNG powered vehicles is now at 28 and more are on order. In addition to these improvements, WCU has empowered
            its community to use greener modes transportation by promoting carsharing and running a free shuttle from campus
            to the Exton Regional Rail station.
        </p>
        <p>DVRPC and the Air Quality Partnership congratulate JM and WCU for their outstanding leadership in improving air quality.
            As ozone season approaches, clean air programming like that at JM and WCU becomes even more critical for our
            region's health and wellbeing. Visit www.airqualitypartnership.org to learn more.
