<p>The AQP is proud to provide the "Where's Mike?" air quality activity workbook for kids. The workbook was designed with the input of educators, school district curriculum committee members, and health and planning professionals to introduce students to the concepts of air pollution, and it may impact children's health. It also offers suggestions about how students and their families can prevent air pollution and protect their health using air quality forecasts provided by federal, state, and local government resources.
